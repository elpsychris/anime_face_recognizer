### Day 1 (May 5th 2018)

In a boring weekend evening after the end of my course in university, I coincidentally read an interesting article from [freedomofkeima's blog - Image Recognition for Anime characters using Deep Learning](https://freedomofkeima.com/blog/posts/flag-15-image-recognition-for-anime-characters).

Well, I'm a newbie in ML and reading formal theories and other complicated stuffs last month really stressed me out. Hence, I guess this little app could be a toy project for me to learn ML in a different and fun (yeah I'm really into anime) approach besides my formal learning path.

The basic features I'm planning for this app to have are:

* Detects anime faces in an image

* Retrieve detail info about the characters whose faces in the image

That's it.
